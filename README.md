# Cloud Backup
## Backup your calendars, adressbook and files* directly from the cloud! 


Thanks to [Tiktaktux-Wiki](https://www.tiktaktux.de/doku.php?id=linux:caldav_und_carddav_backup_erstellen) and [Henry Koch](https://www.henrykoch.de/de/python-loeschen-der-aeltesten-files-in-einem-verzeichnis-nur-die-neuesten-x-bleiben-zurueck) for important bases. ‚ú® 

Further a big thanks to [Cermit](https://twitter.com/Cermit3273?s=20&t=quwG6m5sDXRab5OmeCgPoQ) for the great help to make my first python project! üéâ

_Please notice: This is my first python script. I have coded it attentive and I hope that everything works well without any guarantee of it._  
_Until now the script is tested with [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) under [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/windows/) and some Linux distributions like [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/) and [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)._

### How to:

- Download the repository and put all files in the same directory. üìÅ

- Run __cloud-backup-settings.py__ to config your backups. ‚öô

- Backup your calendars, adressbook and files* by starting the script __cloud-backup.py__. üíæ

- Finished! üéâ 

___Note: You can use the script manually or control it with a cronjob!___ 

\* _Backuping files is a new feature in v.1.2: For this part the client of your cloud has to be installed. The tool creates a zip file with the specified local data in it. For backuping your calendars and adressbook the client isn't needed._
